/**
 * Unit Tests: the reserved fork tiers stay empty upstream
 *
 * CLAUDE.md and CUSTOMIZATION.md both promise that "Sunrise core never creates
 * files or tables under either tier", which is what lets a fork's files there
 * merge cleanly on `git merge vX.Y.Z`. Until now that promise was prose with
 * nothing enforcing it — and the cost of breaking it is not a conflict a
 * maintainer resolves, it is a platform file landing on top of fork code that
 * two forks are already shipping (`components/app/**` in ConQuest and Reclaim
 * Your Week, discovered while fixing #561).
 *
 * Two kinds of reservation, and the distinction is the point:
 *
 *   - **Empty reservations** — Sunrise ships nothing at all. A fork creates
 *     whatever structure suits it. Asserted here.
 *   - **Scaffold tiers** (`lib/app/**`) — Sunrise ships files that export
 *     `null` or an empty function, once, and then does not change them. Those
 *     legitimately have content, so they are deliberately NOT asserted empty.
 *
 * @see CUSTOMIZATION.md "The app/platform model"
